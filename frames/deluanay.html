A web application for comparing online routing algorithms on Deluanay 
triangulations in PHP. Built for CSCI 532 - Algorithms at 
Montana State University, Spring 2014. Landing pages use HTML5 
input types, may display strangely on browsers without support.

                              

Midpoint, Two-Step and Apex Angle algorithms described in:
