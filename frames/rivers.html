The procedure involves randomly placing water sources on an inclined plane and
'eroding' material as it flows downward.

<pre>Topography</pre>
The regularity of the landscape, or how likely water is to flow around obstacles
rather than directly along the steepest path.

<pre>Erosion</pre>
The rate at which water removes material from the landscape. 

<pre>Soil Consistency</pre>
How stable the landscape is after erosion. Defines the threshhold beyond which
steep slopes will collapse into more gradual valleys.

Modeling begins with a smooth inclined plane of topographical elevation data and 
begins a water pathway at a random point on the plane. The water flows to neighboring 
points, with the probability of moving to a given point i defined as:  

Where E is a topographical constant (modeled in the GUI by the Topography scale) 
and Î”h is the elevation difference between the current point and point i. 
The probabilities of each of the four neighboring points is converted to a fraction 
of their sum for their respective percentage probabilities. This equation 
gives the water a larger proportional probability to travel towards adjacent 
points of greater downward slope, and restricts the water from flowing 
to points with higher elevation. After the water has reached the bottom of 
the plane (the plane wraps to itself horizontally) its path is eroded by 
reducing the elevation values it has passed over by some defined erosion depth 
(modeled by the GUI's erosion scale). If the slope between any two points on the 
new landscape is greater than some defined soil consistency constant the procedure 
evens the slope between those points to simulate a soil avalanche. 
A single erosion path will not remove elevation from a single point more than once. 

The placement and erosion procedure can be repeated to produce increasingly complex landscapes.

Python source code requires numpy and matplotlib libraries.
