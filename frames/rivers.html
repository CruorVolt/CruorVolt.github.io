A tool for modeling the growth of river networks over time. 
This program implements the algorithm described by Robert Leheny 
and Sidney Nagel in their 1993 publication, Model for the Evolution of River Networks. 


Process:

Modeling begins with a smooth inclined plane of topographical elevation data and 
begins a water pathway at a random point on the plane. The water flows to neighboring 
points, with the probability of moving to a given point i defined as:  

Where E is a topographical constant (modeled in the GUI by the Topography scale) 
and Î”h is the elevation difference between the current point and point i. 
The probabilities of each of the four neighboring points is converted to a fraction 
of their sum for their respective percentage probabilities. This equation 
gives the water a larger proportional probability to travel towards adjacent 
points of greater downward slope, and restricts the water from flowing 
to points with higher elevation. After the water has reached the bottom of 
the plane (the plane wraps to itself horizontally) its path is eroded by 
reducing the elevation values it has passed over by some defined erosion depth 
(modeled by the GUI's erosion scale). If the slope between any two points on the 
new landscape is greater than some defined soil consistency constant the procedure 
evens the slope between those points to simulate a soil avalanche. 
A single erosion path will not remove elevation from a single point more than once. 

The placement and erosion procedure can be repeated to produce increasingly complex landscapes.


                                             


The initial drafts of the generation algorithm were constructed as part 
of the University of Montana Computer Science curriculum. 
Python source code requires numpy and matplotlib libraries.
